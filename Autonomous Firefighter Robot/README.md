## About the project
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the United States, a country which has one of the higher fire death rates, are estimated 1.318.500 fires in 2018. These fires resulted in 3.655 civilian fire fatalities, 15.200 civilian fire injuries and an estimated $25.6 billion in direct property(including $12.4 billion in losses from major California wildfires) according to the United States Fire Departments.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In an event of a fire breakout, fire spreads rapidly if is not controlled and, in case of a gas leakage there even may be an explosion, so firefighters are constantly at a risk of losing their life. In order to overcome this issue, save the life of our heros, our autonomous firefighter robot comes to rescue.
